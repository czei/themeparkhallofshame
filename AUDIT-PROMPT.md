Work with zen to analyze how best to audit the results.  Given we're
accusing different theme parks of being incompetent, its extremely
important that the numbers be absolutely accurate based on the
numbers we have.  The worst thing would be for someone to find
inconsistencies and therefore cast doubt on the entire project.
Even a single small mistake would make people doubt every other
calculation.  I'd been thinking about an external audit process
that uses screen scraping, but if we used db views for each table,
then those could be "audited" by a separate process daily that would
use AI to discover suspected anomalies.
