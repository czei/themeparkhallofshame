Now let's work on a plan to create a new major category. In addition
to downtime, wait time, and trends, I want to add charts. The charts
in the current trend section need to be moved to the charts tab.
In the current trends area, I want to add Awards, basically. What
are the slowest rides today? What are the least reliable rides
today?  What are the slowest and least reliable rides in the 7 days,
or the last 30 days? There should be two tables added, Slowest Rides
and Least Reliable Rides.  These should go before the MOST IMPROVED
and DECLINING PERFORMANCE.  The time frame selection will of course
be the site-wide toggle for LIVE|7 DAYS|30 DAYS.
