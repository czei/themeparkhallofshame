# Manual Tier Overrides for Ride Classification System
#
# Purpose: Highest-priority classification source (Priority 1) that bypasses all automated classification.
# Use cases:
#   - Correct AI/pattern classification errors
#   - Handle unique rides that don't fit standard criteria
#   - Override tier changes due to refurbishment/closure
#
# Schema:
#   park_id (INT): Foreign key to parks.park_id
#   ride_id (INT): Foreign key to rides.ride_id
#   override_tier (TINYINT): 1 (major, 3x weight), 2 (standard, 2x weight), 3 (minor, 1x weight)
#   reason (VARCHAR): Human-readable justification for override
#   date_added (DATE): YYYY-MM-DD format when override was added
#
# Classification Confidence: 1.00 (manual overrides are always confidence=1.0)
# Reasoning: Stored in 'reason' field
#
# Example Entries (commented out - add actual overrides below):
# 1,101,1,"Space Mountain is signature Magic Kingdom attraction despite AI underestimating",2024-01-15
# 2,305,3,"Dumbo classified as Tier 2 but wait times show Tier 3 pattern",2024-01-20
# 3,450,2,"AI overestimated importance - average wait times under 15 minutes",2024-02-01
#
# Notes:
# - Lines starting with # are ignored
# - Overrides take precedence over exact_matches.json and pattern_matcher
# - Remove row to force re-classification
# - Changes take effect on next classification_service.classify() call
