            <h3>Why This Site Exists</h3>
            <p>Let's get this out of the way: the name is pure hyperbole. Nobody's clicking on a boring website called "Theme Park Uptime Percentages". I built this site because I got tired of hearing that theme parks "aren't what they used to be" every time a ride has the audacity to break down during someone's vacation. I'm an engineer. Hard numbers are my love language. If we're going to argue about theme park reliability, let's do it with actual data instead of your once-a-year vacation anecdote.</p>

            <p>Here's what most people don't appreciate: there's almost nothing harder than keeping an attraction running through a million visitors a year. Engineering something that needs to work flawlessly millions of times annually is orders of magnitude more difficult than everyday engineering challenges. This site is absolutely <em>not</em> an indictment of the people who maintain these parks; they're performing minor miracles daily.</p>

            <p>When I went looking for park-to-park comparisons, I came up empty. Plenty of sites will tell you the wait time for a specific ride, but nothing that compares parks and attractions against each other in any meaningful way.</p>

            <p>The other perennial debate: which parks have the longest wait times. "Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded." Once again, no actual numbers existed to compare parks, so that became the second major feature of this site.</p>

        <section class="about-section">
            <h3>How Scoring Works</h3>

            <p>The problem with this little project is fairly judging one park against another is way more
difficult than you'd think. If you just add up the ride downtime, that penalizes parks with more rides. If you
just go with uptime percentage, you're penalizing parks that have a bunch of complicated rides instead of
simple old-fashioned carnival-style rides.</p>

            <h4>The Shame Score</h4>
            <p>The <strong>Shame Score</strong> is a normalized metric that measures how much a theme park's
downtime hurts guests, accounting for both the <em>amount</em> of downtime and the <em>importance</em>
of the rides that went down.</p>

            <div class="formula-box">
                <strong>Shame Score = (Total Weighted Downtime Hours ÷ Total Park Weight) × 10</strong>
            </div>

            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weighted Downtime</strong> = Each ride's downtime hours × its tier weight</li>
                <li><strong>Total Park Weight</strong> = Sum of all ride tier weights in the park</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Ride Tiers</h4>
            <p>Every ride is classified into one of three tiers based on guest demand and impact:</p>

            <table class="tier-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Tier</th>
                        <th>Weight</th>
                        <th>Description</th>
                        <th>Examples</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><span class="tier-badge tier-1">1</span></td>
                        <td>3×</td>
                        <td>Flagship attractions guests plan trips around</td>
                        <td>Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, Hagrid's, Velocicoaster</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><span class="tier-badge tier-2">2</span></td>
                        <td>2×</td>
                        <td>Major rides with consistent demand</td>
                        <td>Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><span class="tier-badge tier-3">3</span></td>
                        <td>1×</td>
                        <td>Standard attractions, lower guest impact</td>
                        <td>Carousels, smaller flat rides</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h4>Why This Works</h4>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Raw downtime hours unfairly penalize larger parks. A park with 50 rides
will naturally have more total downtime than a park with 20 rides. And 1 hour of downtime on Space Mountain
hurts more guests than 1 hour on a carousel.</p>

            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The Shame Score solves both problems:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Normalizes for park size</strong> — Dividing by total park weight means a small park
and large park with similar reliability get similar scores</li>
                <li><strong>Weights by guest impact</strong> — Flagship ride downtime counts 3× more than minor
ride downtime, reflecting actual guest disappointment</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p><strong>Park A</strong> (small park): 1 Tier 1 ride down for 2 hours = 6 weighted hours.
Total park weight = 15. <strong>Shame Score = (6 ÷ 15) × 10 = 4.0</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Park B</strong> (large park): 3 Tier 3 rides down for 2 hours each = 6 weighted hours.
Total park weight = 45. <strong>Shame Score = (6 ÷ 45) × 10 = 1.3</strong></p>
            <p>Park A has a higher shame score because losing a flagship ride hurts more than losing three
minor rides, even though total downtime hours were the same.</p>

            <h4>Interpreting Scores</h4>
            <table class="score-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Score Range</th>
                        <th>Interpretation</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>0.0 – 1.0</td><td>Excellent reliability</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>1.0 – 3.0</td><td>Good performance</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>3.0 – 5.0</td><td>Average</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>5.0 – 10.0</td><td>Below average</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>&gt; 10.0</td><td>Poor reliability</td></tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p><em>Higher score = More shame = Worse performance (0-10+ scale)</em></p>
