            <h3>Why This Site Exists</h3>
Let's get this out of the way right up front: the name is pure
hyperbole. Let's face it: no one is going to look at a website
called "theme park uptime percentages". I created the site because
all of the online shit-talking about which theme park company "isn't
what it used to be", all because a ride had the temerity to go down
during someone's vacation. I'm an engineer, so hard numbers are the
most valuable and useful things in the world. If we're going to have a discussion
about theme park reliability, let's start with real numbers, not someone's
once a year vacation recolections.</p>
<p>What you may not realize is there's nothing harder than keeping
an attraction working through a million visitors a year. Designing and
maintaining something that has to work millions of time a year with
zero issues is orders of magnitude more difficult than any ordinary
engineering challenge. This is absolutely NOT an indictment
of the men and women who maintain our theme parks. </p> 

<p>But when I tried and find comparisons between theme parks,
none existed. There were plenty of sites that would tell you the
wait times for a particular ride, but nothing comparing parks and
rides to each other.</p>
<p>The other big contrevoursy is which parks have the longest
wait times. "No one goes there anymore, its too crowded".  Again, there
aren't any hard numbers online comparing each park, so that's the
second big analysis on this website. </p>

            <p>The problem with this little project is fairly judging one park against another is way more difficult than you'd think. </p>
