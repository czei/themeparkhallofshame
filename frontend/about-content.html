            <h3>Why This Site Exists</h3>
            <p>Let's get this out of the way: the website name is pure hyperbole. Unfortunately no one (except for me) wants read a boring website called "Theme Park Uptime Percentages". Most people don't appreciate that there's almost nothing harder than keeping an attraction running through a million visitors a year. Engineering something that needs to work flawlessly millions of times annually is orders of magnitude more difficult than everyday engineering challenges. This site is absolutely <em>not</em> an indictment of the people who maintain these parks; they're performing minor miracles daily.</p>

<p>The genesis of this website concept comes from the numberous online posts about how theme parks "aren't what they used to be" every time a ride breaks down during someone's vacation. But when I went looking for hard data on park reliability and couldn't find any. There are plenty of sites that'll tell you wait times, but none of them track park reliability. If we're going to talk about theme park reliability, let's do it with actual data!</p>

            <p>The other perennial debate is which parks have the longest wait times? "Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded." Once again, no actual numbers existed to compare parks, so that became the second major feature of this site.</p>

        <section class="about-section">
            <h3>How Scoring Works</h3>

            <p>The problem with this little project is fairly judging one park against another is way more
difficult than you'd think. If you just add up the ride downtime, that penalizes parks with more rides. If you
just go with uptime percentage, you're penalizing parks that have a bunch of complicated rides instead of
simple old-fashioned carnival-style rides.</p>

            <h4>The Shame Score</h4>
            <p>The <strong>Shame Score</strong> is a LIVE, instantaneous metric that measures what proportion
of a park's ride capacity is currently down, weighted by ride importance.</p>

            <div class="formula-box">
                <strong>Shame Score = (Sum of Tier Weights for Rides Currently Down ÷ Total Park Weight) × 10</strong>
            </div>

            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weighted Down</strong> = Sum of tier weights for all rides currently showing as down</li>
                <li><strong>Total Park Weight</strong> = Sum of tier weights for rides that have operated in the past 7 days (see "The 7-Day Window" below)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is a real-time "right now" score, not cumulative over time. When a ride comes back up,
the shame score immediately drops.</p>

            <h4>Ride Tiers</h4>
            <p>Every ride is classified into one of three tiers based on guest demand and impact:</p>

            <table class="tier-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Tier</th>
                        <th>Weight</th>
                        <th>Description</th>
                        <th>Examples</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><span class="tier-badge tier-1">1</span></td>
                        <td>3×</td>
                        <td>Flagship attractions guests plan trips around</td>
                        <td>Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, Hagrid's, Velocicoaster</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><span class="tier-badge tier-2">2</span></td>
                        <td>2×</td>
                        <td>Major rides with consistent demand</td>
                        <td>Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><span class="tier-badge tier-3">3</span></td>
                        <td>1×</td>
                        <td>Standard attractions, lower guest impact</td>
                        <td>Carousels, smaller flat rides</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h4>What Counts as "Down"?</h4>
            <p>Not all parks report ride status the same way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Disney &amp; Universal</strong>: These parks distinguish between <em>DOWN</em>
(unexpected breakdown) and <em>CLOSED</em> (scheduled closure, like meal breaks or weather). Only
<em>DOWN</em> counts toward the Shame Score.</li>
                <li><strong>Other parks</strong>: Most other parks only report <em>CLOSED</em> for all
non-operating rides, without distinguishing breakdowns from scheduled closures. We treat <em>CLOSED</em>
as potential downtime for these parks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Caveat: Parks that don't publish ride schedules may be penalized if they only run certain
rides part of the day (e.g., only during peak hours), since we can't distinguish "scheduled closure"
from "breakdown."</em></p>

            <h4>The 7-Day Window</h4>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Some rides may be closed for extended refurbishment, seasonal operation,
or other long-term reasons. If we included these in the denominator, parks could pad their score with
rides that haven't run in weeks.</p>

            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The "Total Park Weight" only includes rides that have <em>operated at
least once in the past 7 days</em>. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rides that haven't operated in 7+ days are excluded from the denominator</li>
                <li>Parks can't artificially lower their score with defunct rides</li>
                <li>Seasonal rides are automatically excluded when closed for the season</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Why This Works</h4>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Raw downtime hours unfairly penalize larger parks. A park with 50 rides
will naturally have more total downtime than a park with 20 rides. And 1 hour of downtime on Space Mountain
hurts more guests than 1 hour on a carousel.</p>

            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The Shame Score solves both problems:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Normalizes for park size</strong> — Dividing by total park weight means a small park
and large park with similar reliability get similar scores</li>
                <li><strong>Weights by guest impact</strong> — Flagship ride downtime counts 3× more than minor
ride downtime, reflecting actual guest disappointment</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p><strong>Park A</strong> (small park): 1 Tier 1 ride currently down (weight = 5).
Total park weight = 15. <strong>Shame Score = (5 ÷ 15) × 10 = 3.3</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Park B</strong> (large park): 3 Tier 3 rides currently down (weight = 3 total).
Total park weight = 45. <strong>Shame Score = (3 ÷ 45) × 10 = 0.7</strong></p>
            <p>Park A has a higher shame score because losing a single flagship ride has more guest impact
than losing three minor rides. The score updates instantly as rides go down or come back up.</p>

            <h4>Interpreting Scores</h4>
            <table class="score-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Score Range</th>
                        <th>Interpretation</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>0.0 – 1.0</td><td>Excellent reliability</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>1.0 – 3.0</td><td>Good performance</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>3.0 – 5.0</td><td>Average</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>5.0 – 10.0</td><td>Below average</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>&gt; 10.0</td><td>Poor reliability</td></tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p><em>Higher score = More shame = Worse performance (0-10+ scale)</em></p>
